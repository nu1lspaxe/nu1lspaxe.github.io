## WSL2 Unable to Connect to External Network

**Issue**

- `pip install .` fails to download packages.
- `ping google.com` fails to establish an external connection.
- `sudo apt update` fails when attempting to retrieve updates from external sources.

**Solution**

```bash
wsl --shutdown
netsh winsock reset
netsh int ip reset
```

After restarting the computer, re-enter WSL2 and try again.

### Network Shell (netsh) Windows Sockets (Winsock)

`netsh winsock reset` resets Windows' Winsock configuration to its default state.

### Network Shell (netsh) Interface (int) IP

`netsh int ip reset` resets Windows' TCP/IP stack to its default settings, including IP address allocation, routing tables, and DNS configuration.
